 * Rise plugin automatically loads css files having the same name as the

 * than 404 error for the file, and 503 forbidden for direct access). Even if
 * it seems to work locally.
 * Thus we have to rely on jupyter-notebook global css config mechanism
 * instead. It applies to every jupyter notebook on the server.
 *
 * Unfortunately, it is only loaded through mybinder and not locally. Thus
 * all files have to be conserved for proper usage both locally and remotely.
